Once upon a time , a clever monkey lived in a tree that bore juicy red rosy apples .He was very happy .One fine day,a crocdile swam up to that tree and told the monkey
that he had travelled a long distance and was in search of food as he was very hungry . The kind monkey offered him a few rosy apples . The crocodile enjoyed them very much .
and asked the monkey whether he could come again for some more fruits. The generous monkey happily agreed .
The crocodile returned the next day .And the next.And the next one after that .Soon the two became very good friends.They discussed their lives ,their friends and family
like all good friends do.
